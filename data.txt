AI & Machine Learning Projects:

1. Fine-Tuning DeepSeek-R1 on Medical-CoT Dataset
   - Fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1 using the Medical-CoT dataset from HuggingFace.
   - Conducted training on Kaggle Notebooks with 4-bit quantization for efficient resource use.
   - Enhanced performance on medical reasoning tasks.

2. Multimodal RAG Chatbot
   - Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Groq's LLaMA 3.3-70B.
   - Backend built with FastAPI and containerized using Docker.
   - Designed for Kubernetes deployment with structured folders and deployment manifests.
   - Supports multimodal inputs and fast inference through Groq’s models.

3. Research Companion Using Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Created a tool for researchers that reads documents, summarizes, and generates research reports.
   - Integrated podcast generation using Gemini 2.5 Flash for audio delivery of summaries.
   - Served through a FastAPI backend, optimized for integration with EdTech tools.

4. NL2SQL for Food Delivery Dataset
